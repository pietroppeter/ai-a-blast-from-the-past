  <p>This is a lightning talk for the conference Py4AI
that is finally happening this Saturday
and that I have spent quite a bunch of time
organizing during my past batch.
Also inspired by Ariel on punchcards from a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Not finished.</p>
<p>I have 5 minutes and I though I could fit a short history of AI
since AI really started with ChatGPT less than 16 months ago.
I actually found out that there is more to it, so here is a very compressed history of AI.
... and compression fits very well with AI, after all ChatGPT is just a big zip file, right?</p>

<p>I find fascinating that the first  historical record of AI</p>

<li>
<p>according to Schmidhuber, and who I am to contradict the guy -
is about a form of art that stubbornly refuses to die</p>

  <p>Around 1580, Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel of Prague creates the Golem.
Animated by truth, but lacking free will, a golem always does exactly what is told.
The Golem is incredibly powerful but its obedience also brings danger
(and I think it is not time yet to retire this foundational myth of AI and science fiction)</p>

  <p>In 1770 Wolfgang Von Kempelen built the Mechanical Turk
a chess-playing machine that was revealed only 80 years later to be a hoax.
I guess there is a lesson against closed source AI hidden somewhere inside the Mechanical Turk.</p>

  <p>In 1843 Ada Lovelace added an extensive set of notes to a translation of
Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine called Analytical Engine.</p>
<p>Besides containing the first published program in history
(for a machine that would never be built) it also contains the following remark,
known as a 'dismissal'of AI:
&quot;The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything.
It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths&quot;</p>

  <p>Around 1966 Joseph Weizenbaum develop what we would now called a chatbot
that was able to simulate a a psychotherapist of the Rogerian school.
The technology used is mainly pattern matching using regular expressions.</p>
<p>Weizenbaum said at the time: &quot;What I had not realized is that extremely short exposures
to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking
in quite normal people&quot;.</p>
<p>Later he would become strongly worried about social impacts of AI
saying that the computer, at its most base level,
is a fundamentally conservative force and that despite being a technological innovation,
it ends up hindering social progress.</p>

  <p>In 1979 Hans Moravec during his PhD thesis was able to make the Stanford Cart move
automously around obstacles in a controlled environment.
The vehicle crossed a chair-filled room without human intervention in about five hours.</p>
<p>Nowadays the so called Moravec Paradox is still used to explain why we do not
yet have autonomous driving, despite all the promises that a prominent social media owner can make.</p>
<p>In the words of Moravec the paradox lies in the fact that:
&quot;it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit
adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers,
and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old
when it comes to perception and mobility&quot;</p>
